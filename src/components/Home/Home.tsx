        The Mission Hill LINK was founded in 1977 in response to a neighborhood
        survey by an organization called the Mission Hill Planning Commission.
        This survey showed that residents wanted expanded and improved local
        transportation options. The LINK has served the Mission Hill community
        since then, making it convenient for staff at NEBH to get to and from
        work without adding to the traffic in the area, and for elders living in
        Mission Hill to stay in this community and live full lives. After
        functioning as a program of the Planning Commission, the LINK received
        its own 50 I-c-3 non-profit designation from the IRS in 1988.

        This nonprofit 501c3 has operated the LINK Bus through the Mission Hill
        neighborhood for nearly 40 years. The LINK is a necessity for elderly
        and low-income families needing transport from their homes to Brigham
        Circle and back again for shopping, and to connect to the Green Line,
        bus routes, and Orange Line. This service is not a luxury but a
        necessity to people who live on the Hill, at Alice Taylor and at Mission
        Main.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LINK is an aid to local merchants and banks, to patients of local
        doctors, and to visitors at the schools, hospitals and nursing homes in
        the neighborhood. The LINK contributes to the safety and convenience of
        Mission Hill residents. During inclement weather, students too have
        found the LINK to be a real necessity for getting around the Hill.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The LINK services the Mission Main and Alice Taylor Housing
        Developments, the Longwood Assisted Living facility, the New England
        Baptist Hospital, the Edgar Benjamin Nursing facility, Roxbury
        Preparatory School and the Judge Baker School. The route was recently
        revised to include stope at Ruggles Station and Roxbury Crossing.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        At its inception, then-State Representative Kevin W Fitzgerald worked to
        attain financial support from the MBTA for the LINK. New England Baptist
        Hospital agreed to provide additional support. The third component
        supporting the LINK is grants from local nonprofits and the fares
        charged to the riders. The LINK is managed by a volunteer Board of
        Directors and has no paid staff or office space. Expenses are kept to a
        minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is increasing interest on the part of the Boston Transportation
        Department in “first and last mile” transportation service. This is the
        role the Link has been serving; we hope that other communities are able
        to establish their own local transit and make life a little easier for
        residents of all neighborhoods.
